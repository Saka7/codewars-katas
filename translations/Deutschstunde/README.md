Description:

Everybody knows a little german, right? But remembering the correct articles is a tough job. Write yourself a little helper, that returns the noun with the matching article:

- each noun containing less than 2 vowels has the article "das"
- each noun containing 2/3 vowels has the article "die"
- each noun containing more than 3 vowels has the article "der"

> Caution: Vowels are "a,e,i,o,u". Umlaute (ä ö ü) are also being counted!

( This Kata is a joke, there is no such grammar rule! )
